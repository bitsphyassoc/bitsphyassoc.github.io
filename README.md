This is the code for the website of the Physics Association, BITS Pilani. It is extremely confusing and convoluted. I don't understand some parts of the code myself. The design for the website was adapted from [TemplateMo](https://www.free-css.com/free-css-templates/page267/sixteen-clothing). If you would like to clean up the code or to improve upon anything I'd suggest you trash the entire code and start over from scratch. However, if you're up for the challenge, I did warn you :P
